# arcos_json
On July 15, the DOJ and the DEA released a portion of the Automation of Reports and 
Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) database to the public.  

You can read The Washington Post's coverage and analysis of the database 
[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/76-billion-opioid-pills-newly-released-federal-data-unmasks-the-epidemic/2019/07/16/5f29fd62-a73e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html?utm_term=.699d85f7eaa9).  

All reports in the database are in PDF format, which makes it painful for data 
analysis.  

I am attempting to scrape all PDFs and republish them in JSON format. This repo 
will contain all JSON copies of the report, plus the scripts used to generate them.  

If you have another suggestion for what format to use, please open an issue.
